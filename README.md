# Tree-Command-Implementation
This repository contains Linux Tree Command Implementation Project in C. 

> Tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth-indented listing of files.

> With no arguments, it lists the files and sub-directories in the current directory.

> When the command is used along with path, it lists files and sub-directories from the directory whose path is mentioned.

> Upon completion of listing all files and directories found, tree returns the total number of files and directories listed.

> It features various options for output manipulation, from file options, sorting options, to graphics options, and support for output in XML, JSON and HTML formats.
