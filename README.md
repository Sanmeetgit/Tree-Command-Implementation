# Tree-Command-Implementation
This repository contains Linux Tree Command Implementation Project in C. 

> Tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth-indented listing of files.<br/>

> With no arguments, it lists the files and sub-directories in the current directory.<br/>

> When the command is used along with path, it lists files and sub-directories from the directory whose path is mentioned.<br/>

> Upon completion of listing all files and directories found, tree returns the total number of files and directories listed.<br/>

> It features various options for output manipulation, from file options, sorting options, to graphics options, and support for output in XML, JSON and HTML formats.<br/>

  -H -o filename &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output an HTML format of the tree to filename.<br/>
  
  ------- Miscellaneous options -------<br/>
  --help &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;         Print usage and this help message and exit.<br/>
  --all	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	  Print all information about files.<br/>

# How to run the project?<br/>
1) First compile all project c files using makefile. (Makefile helps to compile uncompiled files only and avoids repetitive compilations)<br/>
Use this command -> make all<br/>

2) To execute the project,<br/>
Use this command (without arguments) -> ./run <br/>
Use this command (with arguments) -> ./run path flag1 flag2 <br/>
Here you can use path and flags if needed.<br/>

3) To clean .o files (object files) and executable file created after project compilation,<br/>
Use this command -> make clean <br/>
